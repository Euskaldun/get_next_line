Find here my get_next_line project. Do not just copy but understand and learn. Make your own tests.
Also bear in mind that copying from one person is copying, but copying from many people is
documentation. Check and compare, and code what suits you better.

Thank you xmatute- and all those who helped me, too many to be listed here. Best regards.
